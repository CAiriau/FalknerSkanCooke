# FalknerSkanCooke
Solution of the Falkner-Skan Cooke equation in Fortran with a continuation method


## Sources

* The code is integrated into a Fortran module in the **src** directory

* For the compilation just write *make clean; make* in a terminal

* The executable named **fsc** will be located in a **~/bin** directory (eventually to create)

## Running

* The input file **fsc_continuation.in** is in the **run** directory.

* To get the solution write **fsc** in a terminal or **.x1.run.sh**

* The bash script **x1.run.sh** can clean your directory, run the code or compile it.

## Documentation

* A documention has been generated with *Doxygen*.

* Open the **index.html** file in the **doc/build/html** directory

* To generate the documentation use the script **.x1.Doxygen**

## History

Please read the doc.

## Version

* Version 2. 
* The code is derived from the FSK code including in my **FundAeroSuite** deposit
